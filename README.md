Small collection of scripts I have found useful in my day-to-day life as a Linux junkie...



Pentest.sh is a script to install...well, basically a crap-ton of pentesting tools on Ubuntu.  It also disables the known NSA PRISM monitoring in Unity.

Chrome.sh is a very simple script to install Google Chrome (as opposed to Chromium), which gives the ability to watch Netflix, use the VMWare VSphere web client, etc.
